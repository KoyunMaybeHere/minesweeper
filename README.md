A simple TUI implementation of the immortal desktop video game,
[Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)), made
using the wonderful [Charm libraries](https://charm.sh/libs/),
[Bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) and
[Lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss).

As of now, only the most essential features that make the game playable are
implemented; the first move is not guaranteed to be safe, and board
configurations in which the player is forced to guess may occur.
